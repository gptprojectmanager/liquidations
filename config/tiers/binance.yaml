# Binance Futures Tier Configuration
# Standard 5-tier structure for perpetual futures
# Maintenance amounts are derived automatically using continuity formula

symbol: BTCUSDT
version: binance-2025-v1

tiers:
  # Tier 1: $0 - $50k @ 0.5% maintenance margin
  - tier_number: 1
    min_notional: 0
    max_notional: 50000
    margin_rate: 0.005  # 0.5%
    # MA = 0 (first tier always has MA = 0)

  # Tier 2: $50k - $250k @ 1.0% maintenance margin
  - tier_number: 2
    min_notional: 50000
    max_notional: 250000
    margin_rate: 0.010  # 1.0%
    # MA = 250 (derived: 0 + 50000 * (0.010 - 0.005))

  # Tier 3: $250k - $1M @ 2.5% maintenance margin
  - tier_number: 3
    min_notional: 250000
    max_notional: 1000000
    margin_rate: 0.025  # 2.5%
    # MA = 4000 (derived: 250 + 250000 * (0.025 - 0.010))

  # Tier 4: $1M - $10M @ 5.0% maintenance margin
  - tier_number: 4
    min_notional: 1000000
    max_notional: 10000000
    margin_rate: 0.050  # 5.0%
    # MA = 29000 (derived: 4000 + 1000000 * (0.050 - 0.025))

  # Tier 5: $10M - $50M @ 10.0% maintenance margin
  - tier_number: 5
    min_notional: 10000000
    max_notional: 50000000
    margin_rate: 0.100  # 10.0%
    # MA = 529000 (derived: 29000 + 10000000 * (0.100 - 0.050))

# Notes:
# - Maintenance amounts (MA) are calculated automatically by the loader
# - MA ensures mathematical continuity at tier boundaries
# - Formula: MA[i] = MA[i-1] + boundary * (rate[i] - rate[i-1])
# - At boundaries, margin calculations from adjacent tiers are identical
#
# Example continuity at $50k boundary:
#   Tier 1: 50000 * 0.005 - 0 = $250
#   Tier 2: 50000 * 0.010 - 250 = $250 ✓
